# OUTPUT 

# To solve this problem, you can use the two-pointer technique. Since the array is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent. You can    
# maintain a "slow" pointer to track the position of the last unique element and a "fast" pointer to iterate through the array.    
# When the fast pointer finds a new unique element, you move the slow pointer forward and update the element at the slow pointer's 
# position.

# Here's a Python function to achieve this:


#  def remove_duplicates(nums):
#      if not nums:
#          return 0
                                                                                                                                 
#      # Initialize the slow pointer
#      slow = 0
                                                                                                                                 
#      # Iterate with the fast pointer
#      for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
#          if nums[fast] != nums[slow]:
#              # Move the slow pointer forward
#              slow += 1
#              # Update the element at the slow pointer
#              nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                                                                                                                                 
#      # The new length is slow + 1
#      return slow + 1
                                                                                                                                 
#  # Example usage
#  nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
#  new_length = remove_duplicates(nums)
#  print("New length:", new_length)
#  print("Array after removing duplicates:", nums[:new_length])


#                                                           Explanation:

#  • We start with the slow pointer at index 0.
#  • The fast pointer starts at index 1 and iterates through the array.
#  • Whenever nums[fast] is not equal to nums[slow], it means we have found a new unique element. We increment the slow pointer and
#    update nums[slow] with nums[fast].
#  • After the loop, the slow pointer will be at the last unique element's index, so the new length of the array without duplicates
#    is slow + 1.
#  • The array is modified in place, and the first slow + 1 elements are the unique elements.
