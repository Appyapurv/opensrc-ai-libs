# OUTPUT 

# To find all pairs of integers in an array whose sum equals a specific target value, we can use a combination 
# of sorting and two pointers approach. Here's an optimized algorithm that handles duplicate numbers and       
# provides unique pairs:


#  def find_pairs(arr, target):
#      arr.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
#      pairs = []
#      left = 0
#      right = len(arr) - 1

#      while left < right:
#          current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
                                                                                                             
#          if current_sum == target:
#              # Found a pair, add it to the result
#              pairs.append((arr[left], arr[right]))
                                                                                                             
#              # Skip duplicates for both left and right pointers
#              while left < right and arr[left] == arr[left + 1]:
#                  left += 1
#              while left < right and arr[right] == arr[right - 1]:
#                  right -= 1
                                                                                                             
#              left += 1
#              right -= 1
#          elif current_sum < target:
#              left += 1
#          else:
#              right -= 1
                                                                                                             
#      return pairs
                                                                                                             

# Explanation:

#   1 We start by sorting the input array in ascending order. This step allows us to use the two pointers      
#     approach efficiently.
#   2 We initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.    
#   3 We enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than right. This ensures that we don't process the
#     same pair twice.
#   4 Inside the loop, we calculate the current sum by adding the values at arr[left] and arr[right].
#   5 If the current sum is equal to the target value, we have found a pair. We add the pair (arr[left],       
#     arr[right]) to the pairs list.
#   6 To handle duplicate numbers, we skip any consecutive duplicates for both left and right pointers. This   
#     ensures that we only consider unique pairs.
#   7 If the current sum is less than the target value, we increment the left pointer to try a larger value.   
#   8 If the current sum is greater than the target value, we decrement the right pointer to try a smaller     
#     value.
#   9 We repeat steps 4-8 until left becomes greater than or equal to right.
#  10 Finally, we return the list of unique pairs.

# Time Complexity:

#  • Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the size of the input array.
#  • The two pointers approach takes O(n) time as we iterate through the array once.
#  • Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n).

# Space Complexity:

#  • The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the pairs list and  
#    the two pointers.
#  • Note that the space required for the output list of pairs is not considered as extra space complexity.    

# This algorithm efficiently finds all unique pairs of integers in the array whose sum equals the target value,
# handling duplicate numbers and optimizing for both time and space complexity.
